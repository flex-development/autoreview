## Usage

Do you work alone? Do you request reviews from your admin account? Is switching
between accounts becoming a hassle? Geared towards lone developers, this action
speeds up your pull request workflow by allowing you to automate reviews.

```yaml
name: Automate PR Reviews
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [review_requested]
jobs:
  automate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: @flex-development/autoreview@v1.0.0
        with:
          body: lgtm üëçüèæ
          reviewers:  flexdevelopment
          senders: unicornware
```
